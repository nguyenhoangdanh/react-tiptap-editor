# React TipTap Editor Library - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: Create a comprehensive, extensible React component library for rich text editing that allows developers to easily integrate and customize every aspect of the editor experience.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Zero TypeScript errors across all components
- All core features (formatting, lists, headings, links, images, tables) work on first click
- Developers can customize extensions, UI components, and styling without modifying source code
- Ready for npm publication with proper build configuration

**Experience Qualities**: Professional, Extensible, Responsive

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality with rich interactions, drag-and-drop, customizable architecture)

**Primary User Activity**: Creating - Users will primarily create and edit rich content with advanced formatting capabilities

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Existing rich text editors are either too basic or difficult to customize. TipTap provides a solid foundation, but developers need a React-specific wrapper that's both powerful and customizable.

**User Context**: Developers building content management systems, documentation tools, blog platforms, or any application requiring rich text editing capabilities.

**Critical Path**: Install package → Import components → Configure extensions → Render editor → Edit content seamlessly

**Key Moments**: 
1. First click on any toolbar button should immediately apply formatting
2. Drag-and-drop image insertion should be smooth and intuitive
3. Developer customization should be straightforward and well-documented

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence and creative empowerment
**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, and sophisticated with subtle interactive feedback
**Visual Metaphors**: Paper and ink - familiar writing tools in digital form
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean interface that reveals complexity progressively

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
**Primary Color**: Modern blue (`oklch(0.6 0.25 240)`) for actions and focus states
**Secondary Colors**: Subtle grays for backgrounds and borders
**Accent Color**: Primary blue for important actions and active states
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and professionalism, grays provide calm focus
**Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast ratio)

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- **Primary text on background**: `oklch(0.15 0.02 240)` on `oklch(0.98 0.01 250)` (19.8:1 ratio)
- **Muted text on background**: `oklch(0.45 0.02 240)` on `oklch(0.98 0.01 250)` (4.7:1 ratio)
- **Primary button text**: `oklch(0.98 0.01 240)` on `oklch(0.6 0.25 240)` (7.2:1 ratio)
- **Secondary button text**: `oklch(0.15 0.02 240)` on `oklch(0.96 0.01 240)` (14.1:1 ratio)

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family approach with Inter for consistency
**Primary Font**: Inter - clean, highly legible sans-serif optimized for interfaces
**Code Font**: JetBrains Mono for code blocks and inline code elements
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- H1: 2rem, weight 700, line-height 1.2
- H2: 1.5rem, weight 600, line-height 1.3  
- H3: 1.25rem, weight 600, line-height 1.4
- Body: 1rem, weight 400, line-height 1.6
**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism and technical precision
**Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing (1.6) and appropriate measure lengths
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent weight progression and spacing relationships

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Toolbar at top draws immediate attention, content area is clearly defined
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding and margins create breathing room and focus
**Grid System**: Flexible layout system that adapts from mobile to desktop
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
**Content Density**: Balanced information density - rich functionality without overwhelming

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions communicate state changes and guide user attention
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Button hover states, selection feedback, and drag operations get priority
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, fast transitions (100-300ms) suitable for productivity tools

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Toolbar with grouped button sections
- Dropdown selectors for headings and alignment
- Modal dialogs for complex operations (links, images)
- Contextual bubble menus for selected text
**Component Customization**: All components accept className props and render prop patterns
**Component States**: Clear visual feedback for hover, active, disabled, and focus states
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent line weight and style
**Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (bold, italic) get prominent placement, secondary actions in dropdowns
**Spacing System**: Consistent 0.5rem base unit with logical progression
**Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive toolbar that collapses appropriately on small screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
**Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent props and styling patterns
**Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, spacing system, interaction patterns
**Visual Rhythm**: Consistent padding, margins, and sizing create predictable patterns
**Brand Alignment**: Clean, professional aesthetic that integrates well with modern applications

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum, many combinations exceed AAA standards
**Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with logical tab order
**Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
**Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical focus flow

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Potential Obstacles**:
- Large image files causing performance issues
- Complex nested list structures
- Browser compatibility with drag-and-drop
- Editor focus management with external toolbar

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Image size validation and compression options
- Configurable nesting limits for lists
- Graceful fallbacks for older browsers
- Proper focus management patterns

**Technical Constraints**:
- Bundle size considerations for npm package
- Browser support requirements
- TypeScript compilation targets
- Peer dependency management

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: 
- Modular extension system for future features
- Plugin architecture for third-party integrations
- Performance optimization for large documents

**Testing Focus**: 
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Performance benchmarks for large content
- Developer API usability testing

**Critical Questions**:
- How do we ensure the package works across different React versions?
- What's the optimal bundle size vs. feature trade-off?
- How do we maintain backward compatibility as TipTap evolves?

## Reflection

**Unique Approach**: This solution combines TipTap's powerful core with React-specific patterns and comprehensive TypeScript support, creating a bridge between raw functionality and developer-friendly APIs.

**Assumptions to Challenge**: 
- That all developers need every feature (hence the preset system)
- That default styling should be opinionated (hence the customization options)
- That the learning curve should be minimal (hence comprehensive documentation)

**Exceptional Solution Elements**: 
- Zero-configuration default experience with full customization potential
- Real-time state synchronization between editor and UI components
- Comprehensive image handling with drag-and-drop and text wrapping
- Developer-first API design with excellent TypeScript support
